# scaling
project investigating the intraspecific temperature- and size dependence of metabolism, consumption and growth using data from a systematic literature search.

# data
we use data at different levels in this study. The key information in each data set are:

**growth**
+ growth rate at optimum temperature
+ optimum temperature for given body size
+ maximum size and natural temperature range (for normalization across species)

**scaling exponents**
+ size scaling exponents of consumption and metabolic rate (2 data sets)
+ experimental temperature
+ maximum size and natural temperature range (for normalization across species)
 
**consumption and metabolic rate**
+ experimental temperature
+ maximum size and natural temperature range (for normalization across species)
+ this data set has fewer species than the scaling exponents data because if the exponents are not reported in the paper, we estimate it using this data, but not all papers that report exponents also report their data.
