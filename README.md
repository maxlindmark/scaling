# Scaling of growth, metabolism and maximum consumption with temperature and body size within species of fish
Project investigating the intraspecific temperature- and size dependence of these rates using data from a systematic literature search.

**Authors:** Max Lindmark, Jan Ohlberger, Anna GÃ¥rdmark

This repository contains all of the clean data and code used to generate the analyses and figures from Lindmark et al (20XX). 

## How to replicate our analyses

### Data
`data`: Data (.xlsx) on metabolic rate, maximum consumption rate, growth rate and optimum temperature for growth. For info on how these data were compiled, see Appendix SX.

`R/exploration`: Code for exploring data, filtering data and exporting for model fitting scripts ( as .csv).

### Analysis
`R/analysis`: Code for all analysis and main figures.

`R/analysis/concept_figure`: Conceptual figure on bioenergetics of growth.

`R/analysis/growth`: Hierarchical Multiple Regression model in JAGS for mass and temperature dependence of growth at sub-optimum temperatures. Code for specifying JAGS models, perform model selection, validation, predictions and evalute model fit.

`R/analysis/meta_cons`: Hierarchical Multiple Regression model in JAGS for mass and temperature dependence of metabolism and growth at sub-optimum temperatures. Code for specifying JAGS models, perform model selection, validation, predictions and evalute model fit.

`R/analysis/non_linear_model`: Quadratic model in JAGS for mass and temperature dependence of consumption using temperatures that include optimum temperatures. Code for specifying JAGS models, perform model selection, validation, predictions and evalute model fit.

### Figures
`figures`: Figures for main text.

`figures/supp`: Supplementary figures (some are not in paper)
