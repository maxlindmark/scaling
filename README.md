# Scaling of growth, metabolism and maximum consumption with temperature and body size within species of fish
Project investigating the intraspecific temperature- and size dependence of these rates using data from a systematic literature search.

**Authors:** Max Lindmark, Jan Ohlberger, Anna GÃ¥rdmark

This repository contains all of the clean data and code used to generate the analyses and figures from Lindmark et al. 

## How to replicate our analyses

### Data
`data`: Contains data (.xlsx) on metabolic rate, maximum consumption rate, growth rate and optimum temperature for growth. For info on how these data were compiled, see Appendix SX.

`R/exploration`: Contains code for exploring data, filtering data and exporting for model fitting scripts ( as .csv)

### Analysis
`R/analysis`: Contains code for all analysis

`R/analysis/concept_figure`: Conceptual figure on bioenergetics of growth

`R/analysis/growth`: Hierarchical Multiple Regression model in JAGS for growth~temperature and mass using sub-optimum temperatures only. Contains code for specifying JAGS models, perform model selection, perform model validation, make predictions and evalute model fit

`R/analysis/meta_cons`: Hierarchical Multiple Regression model in JAGS for metabolism or consumprtion ~ temperature and mass using sub-optimum temperatures only. Contains code for specifying JAGS models, perform model selection, perform model validation, make predictions and evalute model fit

`R/analysis/non_linear_model`: Quadratic model in JAGS for consumprtion ~ temperature and mass using temperatures that include optimum temperatures. Contains code for specifying JAGS models, perform model selection, perform model validation, make predictions and evalute model fit

### Figures
`figures`: Contains figures for main text

`figures/supp`: Contains supplementary figures
